* Understand git clone, git commit, git add, and git push
* Understand the different Markdowns! I find it really interesting to understand how different markdowns can converge and change the format of the contents we put in Readme! 
* Surprise: I love the video on youtube which introduced how GitHub tracks and assists teams to work together to help the tractors work better!
